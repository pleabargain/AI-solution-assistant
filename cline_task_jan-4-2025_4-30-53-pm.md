**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Let me first check my memory bank files to understand the context and patterns for creating decision schemas.

1. I'll read the existing files to understand:
- The product context and purpose
- System patterns for decision schemas
- Technical requirements
- Current progress
</thinking>

<read_file>
<path>cline_docs/productContext.md</path>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
I notice that while the cline_docs directory exists, I'm unable to read the files. Following my core workflows, I need to create/update these files before proceeding with any development work.

Let me first examine the existing decision schema to understand the current structure.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
Now that I understand the decision schema structure, I can create a test decision for "go to the party on a work night". Let me create a realistic test case that follows the schema structure with appropriate pros, cons, and opportunity costs that would be relevant for this type of decision.
