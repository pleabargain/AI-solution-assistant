# Technical Context

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
1. Python
   - Primary development language
   - Latest stable Python version required
   - Ensures access to newest language features and optimizations

2. Ollama
   - AI model integration
   - Default model: ollama-3.2:latest
   - Local connection required

3. JSON
   - Primary data storage format
   - Used for both decision storage and AI responses

### Libraries and Dependencies
- Core Dependencies:
  * ollama-python: Official Python client for Ollama integration
  * JSON handling libraries (Python standard library)
  * Logging utilities (Python standard library)
  * CLI interface tools (Python standard library)

- Development Dependencies:
  * pytest: Primary testing framework
  * pytest-asyncio: For async test support
  * pytest-cov: For code coverage reporting
  * Virtual environment tools

## Development Setup

### Required Components
1. Python Environment
   - Latest stable Python installation
   - Package manager (pip)
   - Virtual environment recommended

2. Ollama Setup
   - Local Ollama installation
   - Default model configuration
   - Port accessibility verification

3. File System Requirements
   - Write permissions for:
     * ./decisions directory
     * decision_maker.log
     * JSON storage

### Development Tools
- Code editor/IDE with Python support
- Terminal access for CLI interaction
- Git for version control (assumed)

## Technical Constraints

### System Requirements
1. Local Processing
   - Ollama must be running locally
   - Port accessibility for Ollama connection
   - Sufficient system resources for AI model

2. File System
   - Write permissions in application directory
   - Storage space for logs and decision files
   - Daily log rotation capability

### Performance Considerations
1. AI Processing
   - Model loading time
   - Response generation latency
   - Memory usage for model operations

2. Data Management
   - JSON file size limitations
   - Log rotation impact
   - Storage space requirements

### Security Constraints
1. Local Operation
   - No external API dependencies
   - Local file system access only
   - No network requirements beyond Ollama

2. Data Handling
   - Local data storage only
   - No encryption requirements specified
   - User input validation minimal

### Compatibility Requirements
1. Operating System
   - Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - File system access using pathlib for OS-agnostic operations
   - Path handling using Path objects for cross-platform compatibility
   - Directory separators handled automatically by pathlib

2. Python Environment
   - Latest stable Python version required
   - Package dependencies to be determined based on latest Python features
   - Virtual environment usage strongly recommended for isolation
