# Active Context

## Current Work
- Initial project setup and documentation
- Memory Bank creation and population
- Project structure analysis
- Core technology decisions

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank documentation structure
- Documented project architecture and patterns
- Established technical context and constraints
- Determined Python version requirement (latest stable)
- Selected ollama-python as integration library
- Updated documentation with technical decisions

## Next Steps
1. Set up Development Environment
   - Install latest stable Python
   - Create virtual environment
   - Install ollama-python library

2. Implement Core Components
   - Create project directory structure
   - Start with model_handler.py using ollama-python
   - Implement basic logging system
   - Develop error handling framework

3. Begin Integration Testing
   - Test Ollama connection
   - Verify model availability
   - Validate logging system

## Questions to Resolve
1. Testing Framework
   - Choose appropriate testing tools
   - Define testing strategy
   - Set up test environment

2. Development Workflow
   - Code review process
   - Testing requirements
   - Documentation standards

3. Deployment Strategy
   - Installation process
   - Dependencies management
   - User setup guide

## Current Focus
Primary: Development environment setup and initial implementation
Secondary: Core component development preparation
Status: Moving from planning to development phase
